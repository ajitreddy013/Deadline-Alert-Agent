# WhatsApp Integration Commands

## To test WhatsApp QR code scanning:

# Replace "Family" with the exact name of your WhatsApp chat
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingest/whatsapp?chat_name=Family"

# Or try with a different chat name:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingest/whatsapp?chat_name=Work Group"

# Or with a friend's name:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingest/whatsapp?chat_name=John Doe"

## What happens:
1. Chrome browser will open automatically
2. Navigate to web.whatsapp.com
3. If not logged in, you'll see a QR code
4. Scan the QR code with your phone (WhatsApp > Menu > WhatsApp Web)
5. The system will search for the specified chat
6. Extract the last 10 messages for deadline detection

## Important Notes:
- Make sure the backend server is running first
- Use the EXACT chat name as it appears in WhatsApp
- The process may take 15-20 seconds to complete
- Chrome profile will be saved for future use (no need to scan QR again)
